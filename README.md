Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
This JavaScript code will allow users to filter the table data for specific values. 
- Created a basic HTML web page 
- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote a code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
- Made a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
- Used a date form in  HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.


Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
Completed all of Level 1 criteria then ;

  Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following   criteria based on the table columns:
  date/time
  city
  state
  country
  shape
  
 Static folder includes:
 - app.js
 - css
 - Index.html

Need to work on the following to get this work completed:
- The data don't load when the pages start i have to search for something to show data.
- The data doesn't reset when changing the search, it just append the data to the table.
